#summary Tutorial to use Dynamo to build a database Ada application

This article explains how to use Dynamo to quickly setup a new Ada
project, design the data model of the application, generate the Ada
model files, build the database and use the Ada Database Objects
library to populate the database using the data model.

The article assumes that you have installed Dynamo, the ArgoUML
application.

== Setting up ArgoUML to use Dynamo UML profiles ==

Before anything, you should setup ArgoUML to use the Dynamo UML
profile.  This step must be done only once for your ArgoUML application.
Dynamo provides a UML profile which contains stereotypes and data types
that are used for the data modeling of your database.  It is necessary
to tell ArgoUML where the Dynamo UML profile is located.

To know where the Dynamo UML profile is installed, run the following
command:

{{{
dynamo -v
}}}

After starting ArgoUML, go in *Settings* => *Profiles* and add
the UML directory in the list of directories that ArgoUML looks for the UML profiles.  These steps are described in the following video:
